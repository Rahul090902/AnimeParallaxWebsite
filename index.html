        If you enjoy watching cartoons, then a good chance that you have watched some form of anime. This style of cartooning has been around for a long time and has been evolving ever since it was first introduced in the 1920s.
        Animation can be used to make all kinds of content engaging, but if you are creating an animated explainer video for your business or brand, you want to make sure itâ€™s done in a way that is professional, and does not come across as childish.Trying to use animation for adults the way it is sometimes used for children is a big mistake
        Successful animated videos have a style and character that is unique and appropriate for the target audience. If you are trying to reach adults, they need to relate to the characters and themes of your video.
